## Markdown Previewer - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

Welcome to my first React project!

I heavily borrowed from the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/).
I also used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.

- [ ] Next step will be using responsive web design principles and front-end libraries like Bootstrap to make it much more usable and visually appealing.

- [ ] Somewhere along the way, I'll also publish it with gh-pages.

And of course, by having this hosted on GitHub I'll get some practice using git with the CLI (something I've always been weirdly nervous about).
